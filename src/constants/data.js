It accumulates in aquatic ecosystems and builds up in fish, a process called bioaccumulation. Larger, predatory fish that live longer (like shark, swordfish, and some types of tuna) have the highest levels. Salmon is generally considered a lower-mercury fish.",

The FDA recommends that pregnant women, those who might become pregnant, and young children eat 2-3 servings of a variety of low-mercury fish (like salmon, shrimp, cod, and canned light tuna) per week. Treatment for severe mercury poisoning requires medical intervention."

          "preventionAndTreatment": "Most cases resolve on their own with rest and plenty of fluids. Severe cases may require medical attention or antibiotics. Prevention: Cook eggs until both yolks and whites are firm. Use pasteurized eggs for recipes that call for raw eggs. Keep eggs refrigerated and wash hands and surfaces after contact with raw eggs."
